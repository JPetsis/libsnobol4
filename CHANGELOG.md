# Changelog

All notable changes to the libsnobol4 project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - unreleased

### Added — Compact Backtracking (Phase 2)

- **Compact choice stack** (`core/src/vm.c`): default choice-stack mode now uses
  delta/write-log records storing only `(ip, pos, changed-capture-diff)` instead
  of full capture-array snapshots. Reduces per-choice memory by ≥50% for patterns
  with ≥10 choice points.
- **Write-log mechanism**: 64-entry circular buffer tracks capture modifications
  (`CAP_START`/`CAP_END`) with deduplication; entries compressed at choice point
  creation and replayed in reverse on backtrack.
- **Choice-stack statistics**: `vm_choice_stack_memory_usage()`,
  `vm_choice_stack_depth()`, `vm_choice_record_average_size()` expose runtime
  metrics for observability and testing.
- **Legacy mode**: set `SNOBOL_LEGACY_CHOICE=1` environment variable to restore
  full-snapshot behaviour for compatibility or benchmarking.
- **Test coverage**: all 1,265 C tests + 183 PHP tests pass in both compact and
  legacy modes; no regressions.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added — jit-cfg-split (Phase 1c)

- **CFG-based multi-block JIT** (`core/src/jit.c`): replaced the single-basic-block
  linear pass-1 with a BFS CFG builder (`jit_cfg_build()`) that discovers up to
  `JIT_CFG_MAX_BLOCKS` (64) reachable blocks per compilation, following both SPLIT
  arms and forward JMPs.
- **Per-block stub emitter** (`snobol_jit_compile_cfg()`): allocates one contiguous
  ARM64 code buffer and emits a separate stub per CFG block in BFS order; stubs
  branch directly to each other via ARM64 `B imm26` — zero interpreter round-trips
  between blocks.
- **Forward-branch fixup pass**: after all stubs are emitted, resolves all
  placeholder `B(0)` instructions to their target stub addresses.
- **ARBNO / backward-edge loop guard**: backward JMP edges get a counted iteration
  guard using callee-saved register `x19` (initialised to `JIT_LOOP_ITER_MAX` = 1024
  per JIT entry); bails out to interpreter when the counter reaches zero, preventing
  infinite compiled loops.
- **`jit_blocks_compiled_total`** counter added to `SnobolJitStats`: cumulative count
  of CFG blocks emitted across all compilations; accessible via `snobol_jit_get_stats()`.
- **Zero-SPLIT fast path**: patterns with a single linear block and no backward edges
  continue to use the existing `op_seq[]` linear compiler path, preserving compile
  latency for straight-line regions.
- **Benchmark scenario** (`bench/tokenize.php`): added 3-arm delimiter scenario
  `',' | ';' | '|'` to exercise the new multi-block SPLIT chain path.
- **CFG unit tests** (`tests/c/test_jit_cfg.c`): 5 new test cases covering
  `jit_blocks_compiled_total` init, single-block counting, 3-arm SPLIT chain block
  discovery, SPLIT backtrack state restoration, and ARBNO loop compilation.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added — SPLIT→ANY Fusion & Bitmap Optimization (Phase 1b)

- **Compile-time fusion pass** (`core/src/compiler.c`): `snobol_bc_fuse_split_any()` detects
  `OP_SPLIT a b` where both arms are a single `OP_LIT`/`OP_ANY`/`OP_NOTANY` followed
  by `OP_JMP` to the same merge point; rewrites to a single `OP_ANY` with a synthesised
  union charclass.
- **N-arm generalisation**: chained SPLIT chains over single-char arms are collapsed
  iteratively into one `OP_ANY`; `'a'|'b'|'c'` → one `OP_ANY`.
- **ASCII Bitmap Optimization** (`core/src/search.c`): added `OP_ANY` recognition in
  `snobol_search_derive_meta()`, routing fused patterns to Tier 3 (bitmap-accelerated)
  search path for O(match_count) execution.
- **JIT ARM64 Fusion Support**: `OP_ANY` already had a compiled path; fusion allows the
  fused op to run in JIT with zero choice-stack pressure.
- **Benchmark Result**: `tokenize_mixed` achieved ~1,600 ops/sec (≥3.4x baseline) with
  Choice Pushes reduced to 0.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Pattern Primitives** – New VM opcodes and AST nodes for classic SNOBOL4 patterns:
  - `BREAKX` – pre-scan optimisation; O(n) advance to character-set boundary with retry choice point (8× fewer backtrack
    ops vs ARB)
  - `BAL` – balanced delimiter matching (configurable open/close characters)
  - `FENCE` – backtracking cut; prevents retrying the current choice point
  - `REM` – matches the remainder of the subject string
  - `RPOS(n)` – end-relative position (n codepoints from end)
  - `RTAB(n)` – end-relative tab (advance to n codepoints from end)
- **Built-in String Functions** (`core/src/string_fn.c`, `core/include/snobol/string_fn.h`):
  - `SIZE` – Unicode codepoint count with ASCII fast path
  - `TRIM` – trailing whitespace removal
  - `DUPL` – string repetition
  - `REVERSE` – Unicode codepoint-safe reversal (two-pass)
  - `SUBSTR` – codepoint-based substring (1-based positions)
  - `REPLACE` – all-occurrences substitution (≈ PHP `str_replace` speed)
  - `REPLACE_CHAR` – 256-byte lookup table character translation
  - `LPAD` / `RPAD` – Unicode-width-aware padding
  - `CHAR` – codepoint-to-UTF-8 conversion
  - `ORD` – UTF-8-to-codepoint conversion
  - `UPPER` / `LOWER` – case conversion (v1: ASCII a-z/A-Z; v2 Unicode planned)
- **Built-in Comparison Predicates** (`core/src/type_fn.c`, `core/include/snobol/type_fn.h`):
  - `IDENT` / `DIFFER` – string identity predicates
  - `LEXEQ` / `LEXLT` / `LEXGT` – lexicographic comparisons
  - `INTEGER` / `REAL` / `NUMERIC` – numeric type predicates
- **VM Built-in Dispatch** – `OP_EVAL` handler with function dispatch table; SNOBOL_TRACE logging; memory
  pre-allocation (20 KiB slab per match call)
- **PHP Binding** (`bindings/php/`):
  - `Snobol\Text` class with static methods mirroring all built-in functions
  - PHP pattern primitive wrappers: `Builder::breakx()`, `Builder::bal()`, `Builder::fence()`, `Builder::rem()`,
    `Builder::rpos()`, `Builder::rtab()`
  - 177 PHPUnit tests total (up from 122), all passing
- **C Test Suite**: 10 new test files covering all new built-ins and primitives
- **Benchmarks** (`bench/`):
  - `bench/tokenize.php` – BREAKX vs ARB comparison
  - `bench/transform.php` – built-in string function performance vs PHP native
  - `bench/unicode.php` – Unicode vs ASCII benchmark
  - `bench/results_builtin.json` – consolidated performance analysis
- **Examples**:
  - `examples/c/builtin_examples.c` – C API usage for all built-in functions
  - `examples/php/text_functions.php` – PHP API usage for all Text:: methods and pattern primitives

### Changed

- `core/src/compiler.c` – added `emit_breakx_c`, `emit_bal_c`, `emit_fence_c`, `emit_rem_c`, `emit_rpos_c`,
  `emit_rtab_c` emit helpers
- `core/include/snobol/ast.h` – added `AST_BREAKX`, `AST_BAL`, `AST_FENCE`, `AST_REM`, `AST_RPOS`, `AST_RTAB` enum
  values and union fields
- `core/src/ast.c` – added creator functions and free/name cases for new AST nodes
- `bindings/php/core_amalgam.c` – includes `string_fn.c`, `type_fn.c`, `pattern_build.c`
- PHP binding version bumped from 0.1.0 → 0.2.0

### Fixed

- PHP `PrimitivesTest` – capture/assign semantics (must use `Builder::assign` to expose `v{n}` in result)

## Pre-1.0 (PHP-Coupled Architecture)

Before the language-agnostic core refactoring, the project used PHP-based lexer and parser
with C-based VM and compiler. This architecture was functional but made it difficult to
create bindings for other languages.

Key components:

- `php-src/Lexer.php` - PHP lexer
- `php-src/Parser.php` - PHP parser producing PHP arrays
- `snobol4-php/snobol_compiler.c` - Compiled PHP arrays to bytecode
- `snobol4-php/snobol_vm.c` - C VM for bytecode execution
